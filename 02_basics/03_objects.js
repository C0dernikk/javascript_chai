// Singleton (Object Literal: Naturally supports Singleton pattern by creating a single instance and providing global access through a closure. Itâ€™s a straightforward approach for ensuring only one instance.

//Constructor: By default, allows the creation of multiple instances. To implement Singleton behavior with a constructor, additional logic is needed to ensure only one instance is created and managed.

//Thus, while object literals inherently create a single instance, constructors require extra steps to achieve the same Singleton behavior

// Object.create --> using constructor

// Object Literals  (The only difference is of Singleton)
